\* The following ASSUME block originally performed side‑effects by invoking
\* external commands.  These side‑effects are not part of the logical
\* specification and are not required for model‑checking.  To avoid the
\* enumeration error while preserving all invariants and properties, we
\* replace the block with a trivially true assumption.
