InitNB == InitParticipantNB /\ InitCoordinator

\* A participant forwards the decision it has already decided upon to another
\* participant (it does not forward to itself).
forward(i, j) ==
  /\ i # j
  /\ participant[i].alive
  /\ participant[i].forward[i] # notsent
  /\ participant[i].forward[j] = notsent
  /\ participant' = [participant EXCEPT ![i] =
       [@ EXCEPT !.forward = [@ EXCEPT ![j] = participant[i].forward[i]]]]
  /\ UNCHANGED <<coordinator>>

\* A participant takes the (pre)decision it receives from another participant
\* into its own forward structure (a predecision is a decision that has not yet
\* been forwarded onward by its owner).
preDecideOnForward(i, j) ==
  /\ i # j
  /\ participant[i].alive
  /\ participant[i].forward[i] = notsent
  /\ participant[j].forward[i] # notsent
  /\ participant' = [participant EXCEPT ![i] =
       [@ EXCEPT !.forward = [@ EXCEPT ![i] = participant[j].forward[i]]]]
  /\ UNCHANGED <<coordinator>>

\* The coordinator's decision is copied into a participant's forward structure.
preDecide(i) ==
  /\ participant[i].alive
  /\ participant[i].forward[i] = notsent
  /\ coordinator.broadcast[i] # notsent
  /\ participant' = [participant EXCEPT ![i] =
       [@ EXCEPT !.forward = [@ EXCEPT ![i] = coordinator.broadcast[i]]]]
  /\ UNCHANGED <<coordinator>>

\* A participant actually decides only once it has forwarded its predecision to
\* every other participant -- this is what makes the broadcast safe.
decideNB(i) ==
  /\ participant[i].alive
  /\ \A j \in participants : participant[i].forward[j] # notsent
  /\ participant' = [participant EXCEPT ![i] =
       [@ EXCEPT !.decision = participant[i].forward[i]]]
  /\ UNCHANGED <<coordinator>>

\* An alive undecided participant may abort if the coordinator has died before
\* informing anyone and no alive participant has already been informed.

  /\ ~coordinator.alive

\* At least one participant must be able to commit even when not every participant
\* voted yes, which is what makes the broadcast non blocking.
