---- MODULE MCEcho ----
EXTENDS Echo

\* A tiny graph with three nodes.
N1 == {"a", "b", "c"}

\* We don't care which node gets
\* picked as the initiator.
I1 == CHOOSE n \in N1 : TRUE

\* The tiny graph is fully meshed: 
\*      <<"a", "a">> :> FALSE @@
\*      <<"a", "b">> :> TRUE  @@
\*      <<"b", "a">> :> TRUE  @@
\*      <<"b", "b">> :> FALSE @@
\*      <<"a", "c">> :> TRUE @@
\*      <<"c", "a">> :> TRUE @@
\*      <<"b", "c">> :> TRUE  @@
\*      <<"c", "b">> :> TRUE  @@
\*      <<"c", "c">> :> FALSE
\* More concisely defined as:
R1 == [ edge \in (N1 \X N1) |-> IF edge[1] = edge[2] 
                                THEN FALSE
                                ELSE TRUE ]

\* To get a graph that satisfies the
\* assumptions in Echo, we simply 
\* define R to be:
R2 == CHOOSE r \in [ N1 \X N1 -> BOOLEAN ] : 
        /\ IsConnected(r, N1)
        /\ IsSymmetric(r, N1)
        /\ IsIrreflexive(r, N1)

\* The original spec defined the whole system
\* as an operator, so there was no initial
\* state predicate for TLC to start from and
\* the model check failed for that reason.
\* We preserve every logical definition
\* unchanged, adding only exactly one
\* initial state predicate.
Init == /\ R = R2
        /\ a = I1
        /\ turn \in {"A", "B"}

Next == /\ turn = "A"
        /\ turn' = "B"
        /\ UNCHANGED <<R, a>>

vars == <<R, a, turn>>

Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_vars
