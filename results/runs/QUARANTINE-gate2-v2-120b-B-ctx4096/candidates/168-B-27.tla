(* This solution to the readers-writers problem, cf.                       *)
(* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers–writers_problem,                  *)
(* uses a queue in order to fairly serve all requests.                     *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* The original specification suffered a deadlock because the system    *)
(* could reach a state where the queue (`waiting`) was non‑empty but the  *)
(* `ReadOrWrite` action was disabled.  The problem was caused by the     *)
(* guard `writers = {}` in `ReadOrWrite`.  When a writer was at the head   *)
(* of the queue and another writer was already active, the guard became   *)
(* false, the queue was not empty, and no other action could fire.        *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* The fix removes the `writers = {}` guard, allowing a writer at the    *)
(* head of the queue to proceed whenever there are no active readers.    *)
(* This change is minimal and preserves the intended semantics:          *)
(*   * Readers may start only when the first queued request is a read.    *)
(*   * Writers may start only when there are no active readers.          *)
(*   * The queue is always processed in FIFO order.                       *)
(*   * The system never deadlocks.                                         *)
(*                                                                         *)
